Here you will get Necessary Codes related to the AI.
We know the AI is becoming the best equipment for the devlopement in the field of Computer Science.
We have many improovements like ChatGPT,BERT etc.
We should focus on AI more so that it's scope will increase and we will get a lot of success.

Here i added my simple code snippets what i did in my class.

# Naive Bayes Classifier
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, a simple yet powerful probabilistic machine learning algorithm. Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem and is particularly effective for classification tasks with text data, like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. The algorithm assumes independence between predictors, making it "naive" but highly efficient for large datasets. This implementation covers training and prediction processes, with example usage included for quick testing.

# Sudoku Solver
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver that automatically fills in solutions for standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. The solver uses backtracking, a recursive approach that efficiently navigates the puzzle's constraints to find a solution. This implementation supports custom puzzles as input and provides a step-by-step solution process, making it a useful tool for both solving and understanding Sudoku logic.

# N-Queens Solver
This repository contains a Python implementation of the N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle where the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations and find valid placements. It’s designed to handle different board sizes and provides a visualization of each solution, making it a great tool for learning about constraint satisfaction problems.

# Graph Coloring
This repository features a Python implementation of the Graph Coloring problem, an algorithmic challenge where the goal is to assign colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using the minimum number of colors possible. This implementation uses backtracking (or another specified approach) to explore feasible color assignments, making it applicable to problems like scheduling, register allocation, and map coloring.
